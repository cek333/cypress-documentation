## 9.0.0

_Released 11/08/2021_

**Breaking Changes:**

- The `nodeVersion` configuration option now defaults to `system`. The behavior
  of the `system` option has changed to always use the Node.js binary/version
  that launched Cypress. If Cypress was not launched via the terminal, Cypress
  will use the `bundled` Node.js version. Addresses
  [#18684](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18684).
- Windows 32-bit is no longer supported in Cypress. Addresses
  [#17962](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17962).
- `cy.contains()` no longer yields the `<body>` element when it matches the
  content of `<script>` or `<style>` tags. Addresses
  [#14861](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14861).
- Custom command implementations are now typed based on the declared custom
  chainables. Addresses
  [#17496](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17496).

**Deprecations:**

- The `nodeVersion` configuration option has been deprecated and will be removed
  in a future release.

**Features:**

- When `null` is passed as the encoding to `cy.readFile()`, the file is treated
  as binary and read as a Buffer. Similarly, `null` passed as the encoding to
  `cy.writeFile()` allows direct writing of buffers. If the encoding is
  unspecified, the default remains `utf8`, matching the current behavior.
  Addresses [#18534](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18534).

**Bugfixes:**

- Sticky elements within a fixed container will now be able to be properly
  scrolled to during action commands. Fixes
  [#4233](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4233).
- `document.referrer` will now correctly reflect the correct value from the
  application under test after `cy.visit()`. Fixes
  [#4295](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4295).
